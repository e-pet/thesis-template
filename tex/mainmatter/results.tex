\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter summarizes the results that you have obtained during experimental validation of the concept presented in the previous chapter.
Note that a clear separation between experimental results and their discussion is to be made: Here, only numerical results, performance plots, etc. are to be shown and described.
Any interpretation of these results -- What do they imply? Which conclusions do you draw? -- is to be postponed to the following chapter.
