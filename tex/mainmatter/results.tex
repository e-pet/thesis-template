\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter summarizes the results that you have obtained during experimental validation of the concept presented in the previous chapter.
Note that a clear separation between experimental results and their discussion is to be made: Here, only numerical results, performance plots, etc. are to be shown and described.
Any interpretation of these results -- What do they imply? Which conclusions do you draw? -- is to be postponed to the following chapter.
This is useful since in the future, some of your interpretations may be clearly known to be false, due to newly acquired knowledge.
In this case, however, the data you have collected during your studies may still be very valuable and hence should be easily accessible on its own.
Moreover, this provides a very important distinction between objective findings, i.e. experimental measurements that you have obtained or other data, and the inferences that you draw from these data, which may or may not be true.
